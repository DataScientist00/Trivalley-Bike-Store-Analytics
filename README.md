Trivalley-Bike-Store-Analytics

Dataset is for Trivalley bike store where they wanted the Data Science team to help to predict customer monthly spend, and whether a customer will be buying a bike or not. 

Note that this has two objectives to build two different models:

* Regression model to predict the AveMonthSpend
* Classification model to predict the BikeBuyerFlag

Exploratory Data Analysis done using Tableau, Sweetviz/Pandas profiling libraries in Pyhton, and Azure/Python for building the ML models.
